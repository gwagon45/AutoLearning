This was to combine examples which came with carla manual_control.py and generate_traffic.py to create image or map generation environment with traffic

The 1, 2, 3 scripts show progression what was done and how

Needs further development to:

1. add weather changes

2. auto map change - looks to be a problem - see last 
script: pygame window does not get updated town at all

3. Looping through maps
