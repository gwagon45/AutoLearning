Objectives (on the way to using RL to build a full model):

1. Take CarEnv from previous RL attempts

2. Make working with Gymnasium (rather than Gym)

3. Make work with traffic, weather, different towns

4. Add another dimension - time to images, 
i.e. add historical images at 0.5, 1,2 seconds prior

5. Use steering and accelerator

6. Change steering to have a buffer like in a real car
example have the code
